Embedded software widely exists in home electrical appliances like
    washing machines, microwave ovens, dryers and dishwashers, in
    mobile devices like PDAs, navigators, mobile phones and smart
    cards, as well as in safety critical systems such as military
    units, medical devices and motor cars. Such systems are often
    equipped with limited memory footprints due to various constraints
    on e.g. product size, power consumption and manufacture
    cost. Paying insufficient attention to resource issues when
    developing software for such systems may result in a corresponding
    software failure after deployment. A real example is the anomaly
    problem of the Mars Rover Spirit which was due to a memory leakage
    problem ignored in the software development process. In some
    cases, such software failure may put human lives at risk. It is
    thus very important to ensure memory safety and guarantee memory
    adequacy for software running on these systems.</p> 
    In this project, we study memory safety and memory usage for
    programs running on embedded devices, where dynamically allocated
    objects may be present. Our aims are to verify memory safety for
    such software, to predict statically (i.e. before a program starts
    to run) and precisely the memory usage bounds and to ensure that
    such software will never require more memory than the device can
    provide. </p> 
     Memory in software systems are typically organised into two main
    components: stack and heap. Stack is an efficient way for using
    and recovering memory spaces, and is important for method
    invocations and transient objects. Heap is used for more complex
    data structures that may live beyond the method calls where they
    are created.  Our first objective was accomplished by a
    multiple-pass analysis which infers automatically memory upper
    bounds on stack and heap usage for assembly-level programs. The
    focus on low-level programs was mainly because optimising
    compilers may render memory analyses done at the source level
    possibly unsafe to use. The initial experimental results have
    confirmed the viability of the approach ([ISMM08],[TASE10]).</p> 
     While the stack bound analysis is generally applicable, the heap
    bound analysis applies only to programs where mutable objects are
    not shared. Programs with shared and mutable objects were left
    into the second objective, for which, we decided to follow a
    logic-based approach as the originally proposed type-based one
    ([SAS05],[ICSE05]) is lack of a precise and concise way to specify
    deep heap properties with must-aliasing and size information. This
    has proven to be a right move as our new specification language
    (based on separation logic) allows us to capture precise
    must-aliasing information for shared mutable objects. It also
    allows us to capture numerical information (size, memory usage,
    contents) together with shape information via recursively defined
    predicates. Our verification system based on this expressive
    specification mechanism can then automatically verify memory
    safety (e.g. no dereference to null or dangling pointers), as well
    as memory usage (i.e. to verify that a program would not require
    more memory than the device can provide), as shown in our
    implemented system ([ATVA09],[SCP10]). By conducting automated
    verification on memory 
    safety and memory usage for programs with shared and mutable
    objects, we have accomplished the second objective.</p>
 Our investigation on the second objective also opened up another
    challenging research problem: can we automatically compute
    user-annotations on the shape (incl. aliasing) and size
    (incl. memory usage) information for programs with shared and
    mutable objects? This problem is undecidable in general, therefore
    appropriate abstraction mechanisms would be required. This becomes
    the main focus of another EPSRC-funded project
    (<a href="./EP-G042322.html"> EP-G042322</a>).
